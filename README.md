# InventoryKeeper
Apply other form of punishment instead of losing all items on players' death.

# Configuation
InventoryKeeper's config file is fully compatible with [death-penalty](https://github.com/randombyte-developer/death-penalty)'s config. Just rename it to inventorykeeper.conf.

# Credits
This project is a fork of [death-penalty](https://github.com/randombyte-developer/death-penalty). I have rewritten this project with Java, and upgraded the plugin to Sponge API 7.0.0.
